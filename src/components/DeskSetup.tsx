                      This is my little command center ‚Äî the place where I've spent countless hours learning, building, and dreaming. 
                      I haven't created a full production-level product yet, but I've built plenty of small projects here, 
                      experimenting with ideas and learning everything I can along the way.

                      I've learned so many things sitting at this desk ‚Äî from understanding AI concepts to watching my favorite 
                      YouTubers talk about startups, coding, and design. Every late-night session here has its own memory. 
                      Sometimes it's me debugging something for hours, other times it's just me watching videos, taking notes, 
                      or planning my next big idea.

                      My laptop isn't some high-end machine, but it's been my constant teammate. It struggles, sure ‚Äî but it never gives up on me. 
                      It's been with me through every crash, every compile, every idea that almost didn't work but somehow did.

                      This setup might look simple, but it's where everything started for me. Every bit of progress, every spark of creativity ‚Äî it all happens right here.
